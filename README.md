# 🛠️ How to Use CodeShell

Welcome to CodeShell, your in-browser code editor! Here's a quick and simple guide on how to get started:

💡 1. Write Your Code  
Select a language tab (HTML, CSS, or JavaScript).  
*Start typing your code in the editor. It's fully live and responsive.*

💾 2. Save Your Code  
Click the "Save" button in each editor panel to store your code in the browser's localStorage.  
*This means your code stays safe even if you refresh or close the tab — and it will be there the next time you visit!*

❌ 3. Clear Code  
Want to start fresh? Hit the "Clear" button to remove the current code from the editor.

📄 4. Download Your Code  
Click "Download" to save your code as `.html`, `.css`, or `.js` files.  
*Use it later in your own projects, or continue building offline!*

👁️ 5. Live Preview  
See your changes instantly in the live preview pane.  
*Any update to HTML, CSS, or JS will reflect immediately in the output.*

🔲 6. Full-Screen Mode  
Click the "Full-Screen" button to focus completely on your code and preview, without distractions.
